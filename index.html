                    As a student of a tertiary institution, 
                    I have witnessed student election activities and the effect they have on students and student politics(candidates).
                    Students who do not reside on campus are usually discomfort to travel distance only to cast their vote 
                    if they do not have any lecture activities and if they do,  spend a lot of time on campus and in ques to execersis their franchase.
                    Candidate, break down their pocket for election campaigns such as posters, hiring of PR systems, and 
                    teams and others just to win.
                    The institution also have nose diave their finances, they spends a lot of finances to provide materials for elections such as papers,  
                    printing ballots, election office etc, in some cases state institutions responsible for elections are hired to organize the election at a fee.  
                    These difficulties inspired me to develop campus elect, a system that gives solutions to any form of elections on campus. 
                    How excited student will feel when their able to execerses election activities and voting at the comfort of their homes, hotels and any where off
                    campus. 
                    How execited candidate will be if their is another plaform to elevate their campaign that cost noting but can reach
                    student, interact, engage, measure performance and have real-time results during election.
                    it is also a hope that this system may be employed in our national election.
